# jlox Interpreter

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

Welcome to the 'jlox' interpreter project, an implementation of a tree-walking interpreter for the 'jlox' language, written in Java, as described in Robert Nystrom's book, "*Crafting Interpreters*". This project follows the book's content while tackling additional challenges and features introduced in each chapter.

## About the Project

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of compilers and programming language theory through the implementation of a functional 'jlox' interpreter. It aligns closely with Robert Nystrom's book, "Crafting Interpreters," and goes beyond the book's content by addressing additional challenges and features introduced in each chapter.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of compilers and programming language theory. By implementing a 'jlox' interpreter, I aim to gain hands-on experience with key concepts such as lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and interpreter design. The additional challenges and features introduced in each chapter serve as valuable exercises to expand my knowledge and skills in this domain.
   
## Code Organization
This project is organized to facilitate the development of challenges and features introduced in the book. Each challenge will be developed on a separate branch and later merged into the main branch to keep the codebase organized and to serve as a solution hub for the book's challenges.

## Building
I'll add this at some point...
