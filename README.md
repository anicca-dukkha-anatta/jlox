Welcome to the 'jlox' interpreter project, an implementation of a tree-walking interpreter for the 'jlox' language, written in Java, as described in Robert Nystrom's book, "*Crafting Interpreters*".

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a hands-on explioration of compilers and programming language theory. By implementing the 'jlox' interpreter, I aim to gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of key concepts such as lexical analysis, parsing, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and interpreter design. The additional challenges and features introduced in each chapter serve as valuable exercises to expand my knowledge and skills in this domain.
   
## Challenges
The book provides challenges in each chapter that may ask you to implement an additional feature or functionality to the language on your own.

This project is organized to facilitate the development of the challenges. Each challenge will be developed on a separate branch and later merged into the main branch to keep the codebase organized and to serve as a solution hub for the book's challenges.

## Building
I'll add this at some point...
